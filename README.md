## Description

The aim of this project was to to build the back end for an e-commerce site. For this purpose, a working Express.js API was configured to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database. This application allows a user to create, update, and delete entries from tables of the e-commerce website, such as tags, products, and categories. Working on this project helped me gaininng further understanding of how to create a backend that allows to interact with a database.

## Installation

To create this app, Sequelizer, MySQL2 and the dotenv package were installed.

## Usage

This app may be used to retrieve information from the database such as the information on all products, tags, and categories, or to retriev information on one entry by its ID. In addition, a user can create new entries, update and delete existent ones.
